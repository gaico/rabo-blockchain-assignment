# rabo-blockchain-assignment

I created a contract on the ropsten test chain for the BlockBliek token, the Bliek is an alternative currency meant for Gorinchem. It is a time for time kind of deal.
They now have a centralized system for the administration of their coin. I kind of took the idea of putting this coin on a blockcahin as the use-case for this assignment.  

Playing around with web3j has been on my wishlist for a little while so i decided to create a frontend/backend application using spring boot and web3j at the back and ionic at the front.

###Backend
The backend consits of three restfull services:  
http://server/users  
http://server/user/Summer  
http://server/user/Rick/transfer?to=Summer&amount=1000

The transfers can be viewed at the here: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x06a6be20a421f568bbee64459a902e620b6d6387
